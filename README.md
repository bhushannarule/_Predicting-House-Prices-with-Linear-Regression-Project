# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Linear-Regression-Project

# 1. Data Collection
# Objective: Obtain a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for prediction.

# Steps:
# Source data from reliable databases or platforms like Kaggle.
# Ensure the dataset includes necessary features like size, number of rooms, location, etc., and a target variable such as house prices.

# 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
# Objective: Understand the dataset, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.

# Steps:
# Perform an initial examination of the data structure.
# Identify and handle missing values and outliers.
# Standardize data formats and types

# 3. Feature Selection
# Objective: Identify relevant features that contribute to the predictive model.

# Steps:
# Use correlation analysis to identify relationships between features and the target variable.
# Implement techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most impactful features.

# 4. Model Training
# Objective: Implement linear regression using a machine learning library such as Scikit-Learn.

# Steps:
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Train the linear regression model on the training data.
# Fine-tune the model parameters to improve performance.

# 5. Model Evaluation
# Objective: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

# Steps:
# Make predictions on the test dataset.
# Calculate evaluation metrics like MSE and R-squared to measure model accuracy

# 6. Visualization
# Objective: Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between predicted and actual values.

# Steps:
# Use scatter plots to visualize predicted vs. actual values.
# Generate residual plots to assess the fit of the model.
